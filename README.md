Experimenting with Python
=========================

This is a collection of Python code I've written over time to help solve different problems or perform different tasks.

Things that influenced the writing of this code:
* Assigment problems in Math and Computer Science courses
* Problems from ProjectEuler.net
* Python programs are fun to write!
